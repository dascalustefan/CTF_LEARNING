TLDR:

```POST /api/status?door_id=2 HTTP/1.1
X-Backend-Info: {"Transfer-Encoding":"chunked","Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}

```

You have to get the content-Length well
or you're screwed and the request will wait forever cuz you injected a chunked message

The door number 17 has the flag

First request to check for site health:

Second request to unlock the door:

Third request to get the flag is illustrated first.

The vulnerability is in the ability to set a header in the request that the front end does to the back-end

The /api/status call is vulnerable as you can set the Transfer-Encoding":"chunked flag and send a second request which will be sent by the first server. Using that we send a second request to the door open api
